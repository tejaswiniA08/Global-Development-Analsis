![Project Banner](https://public.tableau.com/views/InfoVizualisation-Group-5/D1-Overview?\:language=en-US\&publish=yes&\:sid=&\:display_count=n&\:origin=viz_share_link)

This project presents a series of interactive Tableau dashboards that explore **economic, educational, technological, climatic, and health indicators** across 227 countries. It visualizes how development factors such as GDP, literacy rate, mobile access, and climate vary globally, using a cleaned and enhanced dataset.

## üìå Project Objective

The goal is to transform raw global indicators into meaningful insights using intuitive, user-friendly, and interactive Tableau dashboards.

---

## üìä Dashboards Included

1. **Overview**
   High-level global view of GDP, literacy, population, and health indicators.

2. **Economic Indicators**
   Analysis of GDP per capita vs. literacy rates.

3. **Sector Contributions**
   Breakdown of GDP contributions from agriculture, industry, and services.

4. **Climate & Agriculture**
   Study of climate types and their influence on agricultural productivity.

5. **Mobile Impacts**
   Relationship between mobile phone usage, GDP, and literacy rates.

6. **Health Indicators**
   Trends in birth/death rates, infant mortality, and net migration.

---

## üß† Key Insights

* Higher GDP correlates with higher literacy and mobile phone penetration.
* Countries with tropical and temperate climates show better agricultural performance.
* Developed countries have dominant service sectors, while developing ones rely more on agriculture.
* Health outcomes and migration patterns are interlinked, with better healthcare drawing positive migration.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

* **Economic:** GDP per capita, sectoral contributions
* **Health:** Birth rate, death rate, infant mortality
* **Social:** Literacy, population, net migration
* **Environmental:** Climate type, arable land, area

> The original dataset was cleaned, normalized, and enhanced with calculated fields like GDP category, literacy level, and dominant sector.
