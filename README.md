🌍 Global Development Analysis — Tableau Dashboard

This project presents a series of interactive Tableau dashboards that explore **economic, educational, technological, climatic, and health indicators** across 227 countries. It visualizes how development factors such as GDP, literacy rate, mobile access, and climate vary globally, using a cleaned and enhanced dataset.
